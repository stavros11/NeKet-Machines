### Currently working
- Open MPS in Ising1D and Heisenberg1D.

### Not sure
- Open MPS in BoseHubbard1D works but probably converges to wrong energy (larger bond dimension needed?)

### Minor changes to do
- (**DONE**) Add double to int map and index sorting in Periodic MPS similarly to the Open to make it work too.
- Use inheritance to define Open MPS from the Periodic one in order to delete similar functions in the code.

### Additions
- Canonical form option.
- 2D systems (get data from graph object?)
